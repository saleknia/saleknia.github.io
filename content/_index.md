  #       During my master's program, I specialized in computer vision, culminating in a thesis on an innovative knowledge distillation strategy for image segmentation. I gained experience in Human Action Recognition and Scene Classification, and conducted experiments with medical image segmentation datasets, including BSUI, TNUI, Synapse, and ISIC (2016–2018). These efforts led to several publications, with additional manuscripts currently in preparation or revision. Overall, I have developed strong expertise in machine learning, computer vision, image segmentation, image classification, and medical image analysis.
